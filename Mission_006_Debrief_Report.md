# Mission 006 Debrief Report

## Overview
Implemented the Pub/Sub-triggered `generateAdaptiveNudges` Cloud Function that assembles user context, performs Pinecone-backed retrieval augmented generation, orchestrates GPT-5 zero-retention prompts, and persists both live nudges and HIPAA-compliant audit trails.

## Key Deliverables
* **GCF Function (`generateAdaptiveNudges`):** Added the `generateAdaptiveNudges` handler exported through the backend entrypoint. It iterates through onboarded users, collecting profile preferences (tier, tone, primary module) plus recent protocol adherence and wearable metrics via Supabase service accessors.
* **RAG Integration:** The service builds a context string from adherence and biometrics, embeds it with `text-embedding-3-large`, and queries the `wellness-protocols` Pinecone index (top 5 with metadata) to ground subsequent coaching suggestions.
* **AI Nudge Generation:** Using the Blueprint system prompt, the function calls the OpenAI `gpt-5-turbo` (zero-retention tier) chat completion API with function-calling instructions to obtain structured nudge JSON that includes reasoning and DOI citations. Metadata gaps are filled from RAG results when necessary.
* **Fallback Logic:** When OpenAI errors are thrown, the workflow cascades to a rule-based generator informed by biometrics/adherence and then to tier-specific cached nudges, capturing the fallback reason for auditing.
* **Firestore Output:** Each generated or fallback nudge is written to `live_nudges/{user_id}/entries/{timestamp}` with ISO8601 timestamps, pending status, and source tagging for downstream clients.
* **Supabase Audit Logging:** Every attempt—successful or fallback—stores an expanded record in the `ai_audit_log` table, including prompt text, contextual snapshot, RAG sources, chosen model, errors, and metadata for Mission 007 feedback loops.
* **Secrets Management:** OpenAI and Pinecone clients pull credentials from environment variables through shared helpers, mirroring existing backend patterns for Firebase Admin and Supabase service keys.
* **Tests:** Jest suites mock Supabase, Pinecone, Firestore, and OpenAI to verify happy-path nudges, fallback behavior, audit logging, and Firestore writes. (Execution in this environment remains blocked because dependencies cannot be installed without network access.)

## Integration Points & Verification
* **Pub/Sub Trigger:** The function is exported for Pub/Sub invocation, matching the nightly/burst workflow defined in the blueprint.
* **Supabase Reads/Writes:** Service-role Supabase clients read from `users`, `protocol_logs`, and `wearable_data_archive`, then insert into `ai_audit_log`, mirroring Mission 002/015 contracts.
* **Pinecone Queries:** Retrieval uses the populated `wellness-protocols` index with cosine similarity, returning protocol metadata and citations for grounding.
* **OpenAI API Calls:** The OpenAI helper centralizes zero-retention API key usage and model selection for `gpt-5-turbo` function calling.
* **Firestore Writes:** Nudges are stored at `live_nudges/{user_id}/entries/{timestamp}`, ready for Mission 011 consumption.

## Issues & Blockers Encountered
* Local execution of Jest is currently blocked in this environment due to restricted access to install Google Cloud dependencies (e.g., `@google-cloud/pubsub`). CI or developer machines with registry access should confirm the suite.

## Readiness for Mission 007 & 011
* **Mission 007 (AI Audit & Feedback):** The `ai_audit_log` entries include the full schema (prompt, context, rag sources, response payload, fallback metadata, placeholder feedback fields) so Mission 007 can surface records for review and collect user feedback.
* **Mission 011 (Client UI):** Firestore now streams actionable nudges at `live_nudges/{user_id}/entries/{timestamp}`, giving the client app immediate access to the latest pending prompts.
*Outputs shared with follow-on missions: Cloud Function name `generateAdaptiveNudges`, Pinecone index `wellness-protocols`, and Firestore/Audit path conventions documented above.*
