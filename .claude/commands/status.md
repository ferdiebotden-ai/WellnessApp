Read STATUS.md and provide a concise summary:

1. **Current Phase**: Which phase and session number
2. **Last Session**: What was accomplished (1-2 sentences)
3. **Next Priority**: The specific task to work on
4. **Blockers**: Any known issues that might affect next work
5. **Test Status**: Current test pass/fail counts

Format as a brief status card, not a full document reading.
