description: Start a new development session - reads STATUS.md and confirms priorities
---

Resume session for Apex OS.

**Session Initialization Protocol:**

1. **Read STATUS.md** — Identify current phase, last session work, and next priority
2. **Announce state**: "Resuming session. Last: [X]. Next: [Y]."
3. **If task involves code**: Read relevant files before proposing changes
4. **Output execution plan** with specific files to create/modify
5. **Wait for approval** before writing any code
6. **Enhanced Planning** — Leverage full capabilities:
   - Use sub-agents for research and parallel exploration
   - Apply relevant skills (frontend-design, webapp-testing)
   - Web search for current best practices when needed
   - Reference PRD for UI/UX alignment with Apex OS vision

   **Include a TL;DR section** at the end of each plan for founder review (non-technical, 3-5 bullets).
