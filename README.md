## Development Workflow with Claude Code

This project uses **Claude Code** (Anthropic's CLI for Claude) as the AI development agent, powered by **Claude Opus 4.5**. Here's how the workflow operates:

### AI Agent Setup
- **Model:** Claude Opus 4.5 (200k context window)
- **MCP Servers:** GitHub (PR/issue management), IDE (diagnostics)
- **Skills:** frontend-design, webapp-testing, canvas-design, theme-factory
- **Configuration:** See `CLAUDE.md` for complete agent instructions

### Development Cycle
1. **Human** provides task description to Claude Code
2. **Claude** reads `STATUS.md` for current project state
3. **Claude** creates execution plan and waits for approval
4. **Claude** writes production code (complete implementations, no placeholders)
5. **Claude** commits changes after each completed task (auto-sync workflow)
6. **Claude** pushes to remote and updates `STATUS.md`

### Auto-Sync Workflow
After completing each task that modifies code:
1. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
2. Commit with descriptive message
3. Push to remote: `git push origin <branch>`
4. Mark task as completed

**Important:** Claude commits and pushes after each task for continuous GitHub sync.

### GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
1. Push to `main` triggers CI/CD pipeline
2. GitHub Actions runs linting, testing, and deployment
3. Test results available in Actions tab

---

## Running Tests Locally (For Humans)

### Backend Tests (Jest)
```bash
npm run test:backend
```

Runs unit and integration tests for Google Cloud Functions.

### Frontend E2E Tests (Playwright)
```bash
# Install browsers first (one-time setup)
npx playwright install --with-deps

# Run tests
npm run test:ci
```

Runs end-to-end tests for user workflows.

### All Tests
```bash
npm run test:backend && npm run test:ci
```

## Mission-Based Development

This project follows a mission-based development approach where each feature is defined as a MISSION_XXX in the Blueprint document:

- **MISSION_001-005:** Infrastructure provisioning (Terraform, Firebase, Supabase)
- **MISSION_006-010:** AI coaching engine and adaptive nudging
- **MISSION_011-020:** Feature modules (gamification, analytics, onboarding)
- **MISSION_021-025:** Business and monetization features
- **MISSION_026-030:** Launch, compliance, and advanced AI features

Each mission is assigned to Codex via a requirements-focused prompt generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro.

---

## Key Technologies

### Backend
- **Google Cloud Functions** (Node.js 20, TypeScript)
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security)
- **Firebase Authentication** (Identity provider)
- **OpenAI API** (GPT-4, zero-retention mode for HIPAA compliance)
- **Pinecone** (Vector database for RAG)

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** (App Router, React 18, TypeScript 5)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Styling)
- **React Native** (Mobile app - future)

### Infrastructure
- **Terraform** (Infrastructure as Code)
- **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD)
- **GCP** (Cloud platform)

---

## Deployment Pipeline (CI/CD)

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment on push to `main` branch. The workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) runs three jobs:

1. **Lint**: Validates code style across root and functions directories
2. **Test**: Runs backend tests (vitest) and E2E tests (Playwright)
3. **Deploy Functions**: Deploys all Google Cloud Functions to production

### Required GitHub Secrets

Configure these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: Service account JSON key for GCP authentication
- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: Your Google Cloud Project ID

### Deployment Process

1. Push to `main` branch triggers the workflow
2. Lint and test jobs run in parallel
3. If tests pass, GCF deployment begins
4. All functions are deployed to `us-central1` region
5. Functions are accessible via HTTP triggers

### Manual Deployment

To deploy functions manually:

```bash
cd functions
npm run build
gcloud functions deploy <function-name> \
  --gen2 \
  --runtime=nodejs20 \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --entry-point=<entry-point> \
  --trigger-http \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --source=. \
  --project=$GCP_PROJECT_ID
```

## Feature Flags

### Overview

The application uses **Firebase Remote Config** for feature flag management, enabling:
- Phased feature rollouts
- Emergency killswitches
- A/B testing capabilities
- Zero-downtime feature toggles

### Feature Flag Keys

All feature flags are defined in `client/src/services/featureFlags.ts`:

| Flag Key | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `enable_module_sleep` | `true` | Sleep Optimization module |
| `enable_module_morning` | `true` | Morning Routine module |
| `enable_module_focus` | `true` | Focus & Productivity module |
| `enable_module_stress` | `true` | Stress & Emotional Regulation module |
| `enable_module_energy` | `true` | Energy & Recovery module |
| `enable_module_dopamine` | `true` | Dopamine Hygiene module |
| `enable_ai_chat` | `true` | AI Coach chat killswitch |

### Setting Up Feature Flags in Firebase Console

1. Navigate to Firebase Console → Remote Config
2. Create a new parameter for each flag key listed above
3. Set default value to `true` (boolean)
4. Publish the configuration
5. Changes take effect within 12 hours (cache expiration) or immediately after app refresh

### Using Feature Flags in Code

```typescript
import { useFeatureFlags } from '../hooks/useFeatureFlags';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { isModuleEnabled, isAiChatEnabled } = useFeatureFlags();
  
  if (!isModuleEnabled('sleep')) {
    return null; // Hide component
  }
  
  return <ModuleComponent />;
};
```

### Emergency Killswitch

To disable AI chat immediately:

1. Open Firebase Console → Remote Config
2. Find `enable_ai_chat` parameter
3. Set value to `false`
4. Publish configuration
5. AI chat button disappears from UI within cache expiration period (12 hours max)

### Testing Feature Flags

Feature flags can be tested locally by modifying `client/src/services/featureFlags.ts` default values, or by configuring Firebase Remote Config with test values.

## Configuration Files

### `CLAUDE.md`
Instructs Claude Code on project conventions, coding standards, and development workflow. **Critical:** This file defines the auto-sync workflow and session state management via `STATUS.md`.

### `package.json`
- `test:ci` - Playwright tests (run by GitHub Actions)
- `test:backend` - Jest tests for backend
- No default `test` script to prevent Codex from auto-running tests

### `jest.config.js`
Configuration for backend unit testing with Jest.

### `playwright.config.ts`
Configuration for frontend E2E testing with Playwright.
