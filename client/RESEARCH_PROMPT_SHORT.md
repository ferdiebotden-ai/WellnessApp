# Quick Copy-Paste Research Prompt

I'm developing a React Native app with Expo SDK 51 using Development Build (expo-dev-client). I'm on Windows 11 with PowerShell and need to test on an iPhone. My app uses native modules: react-native-health (HealthKit), expo-secure-store, expo-local-authentication (biometrics), react-native-purchases, and mixpanel-react-native.

Questions:
1. Is Expo Go possible with custom native modules in SDK 51 (Nov 2025)? Any recent changes allowing HealthKit/biometrics in Expo Go?
2. Best testing strategy for Windows dev machine + iPhone? EAS Build vs remote Mac vs other options?
3. Development Build best practices: rebuild frequency, build times, workflow recommendations?
4. Can I test Android first (buildable on Windows) then iOS separately?
5. Cost comparison: EAS Build free tier limits vs alternatives?
6. Any upcoming Expo features (late 2025/2026) that might change Development Build workflow?

Need confirmation on whether Expo Go is possible and the most efficient testing approach for my setup.
