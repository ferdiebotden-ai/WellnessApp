## 1. Executive Summary

Wellness OS's user engagement and behavioral systems form the core retention engine, designed to transform evidence-based protocols into sustainable daily habits for performance professionals. This synthesis integrates eight specialized research domains into a unified architecture spanning social accountability, gamification, notifications, onboarding, lapse recovery, monetization timing, and microcopy standards.

**Key Systems & Targets:**

- **Social Accountability:** Streaks with grace mechanisms (1 freeze/week), private challenges (2-10 friends, 7-30 day cycles), anonymous leaderboards (opt-in, top 10 + user rank only), team challenges (5-10 users, collective goals), share cards for viral growth with anti-shame safeguards

- **Gamification:** Non-linear progression (Level 1→2: 50 XP, Level 5→6: 800 XP), milestone badges (7/14/30/60/100/365 days), protocol mastery levels (Beginner→Master), unlockable content (NSDR at 30 days), variable rewards (10% surprise unlocks), confetti celebrations (2-sec Lottie animations), one-time streak repair for streaks ≥30 days

- **Notifications:** 2-4/day max by tier, quiet hours enforcement (22:00-06:00 local), adaptive spacing (reduce 50% after 70% dismissal rate), DND integration (iOS Critical Alerts for health-critical nudges, Android silent delivery), 24/48/72h re-engagement sequences, platform-specific limits (iOS title ≤50 chars, Android ≤65 chars)

- **Onboarding:** 3-5 min time-to-first-win, 3 core questions only (goal, wake_time, wearables), progressive profiling Days 2-14, tier-specific paths (Free/Core/Pro/Elite), permission requests post-value delivery (notifications after first nudge, health data Day 2-3), target 60% onboarding completion, 70% D7 retention

- **Lapse Recovery:** Detect within 24h (2 consecutive missed days OR <4 days/week for 2 weeks), three-level escalation (LEVEL_1: curious nudge, LEVEL_2: simplification offer, LEVEL_3: pause mode), self-compassion tone guidelines, protocol simplification logic (reduce active_protocol_count by 50%), target 60% recovery to ≥4 days/week within 14 days

- **Celebration & Monetization:** Celebrate-first, upgrade-second timing (2.5-sec delay), 7-day streak = primary conversion trigger (20.3% trial start rate benchmark), 30-day streak for Core→Pro upgrade, protocol mastery celebrations, Free→Core target 5% within 30 days, trial-to-paid conversion 15-20%, refund rate target <5%, refund alternatives (pause, downgrade, discount)

- **Microcopy:** 8-second attention window, notifications ≤10 words/≤60 chars, Flesch-Kincaid Grade ≤8 (target 6), plain language rules (jargon translations: "HRV"→"how well you recover", "circadian"→"body clock"), brand voice (confident, concise, proof-first, coach-next-door), CTA optimization (first-person "my" = +90% conversion, personalized = +202%), automated validation (Hemingway/Grammarly API)

**North Star Metrics:**
- D1 Activation: ≥60% (first protocol within 24h)
- D7 Retention: ≥70%
- D30 Adherence: ≥40% (≥20 days with ≥1 protocol)
- Free→Core Conversion: ≥5% by Day 30 (target 15%)
- Refund Rate: <5%
- Lapse Recovery: 60% return to ≥4 days/week within 14 days

## 2. Social Accountability System

### 2.1 Personal Streak System

**Definition:**
Consecutive days with ≥1 protocol completed (any protocol counts). Day boundary = midnight in user's local timezone (NOT UTC). Rationale: Users mentally anchor to calendar days, not UTC resets.

**Streak Calculation (Cloud Function, triggers daily at 00:01 user local time):**

```
FOR each user:
  // Step 1: Check yesterday's adherence
  User_Adherence_Yesterday = COUNT(protocols_completed WHERE date = YESTERDAY AND user_id = current_user) >= 1

  // Step 2: Update streak based on adherence
  IF User_Adherence_Yesterday = TRUE:
    User_Current_Streak += 1
    User_Last_Activity_Date = YESTERDAY

    // Update longest streak if current exceeds it
    IF User_Current_Streak > User_Longest_Streak:
      User_Longest_Streak = User_Current_Streak
      Log: "New longest streak: [User_Current_Streak] days"

  ELSE IF User_Adherence_Yesterday = FALSE:
    // Check if streak freeze is available
    IF User_Streak_Freeze_Available = TRUE AND User_Opted_Into_Freeze = TRUE:
      // Use streak freeze (preserve streak, mark freeze as used)
      User_Streak_Freeze_Available = FALSE
      User_Streak_Freeze_Used_Date = TODAY
      User_Current_Streak = User_Current_Streak  // No change to streak

      // Send notification
      SEND_NOTIFICATION(
        title: "Streak Freeze Used ❄️",
        body: "Your [User_Current_Streak]-day streak is safe! You'll get another freeze next Monday.",
        action_url: "/protocols"
      )

      Log: "Streak freeze used, streak preserved at [User_Current_Streak] days"

    ELSE:
      // Reset streak to 0
      User_Current_Streak = 0
      User_Last_Activity_Date = NULL

      // Positive reframing notification
      SEND_NOTIFICATION(
        title: "Streak Paused",
        body: "Your streak paused at [User_Previous_Streak] days. Your longest streak ([User_Longest_Streak] days) is still preserved. Ready to start fresh? [Start New Streak]",
        action_url: "/protocols"
      )

      Log: "Streak reset to 0, longest streak preserved: [User_Longest_Streak] days"

  // Step 3: Check for milestone badge unlocks
  CHECK_MILESTONE_BADGES(User_Current_Streak)
```

**Streak Freeze Mechanism:**

```
STREAK_FREEZE_RULES:
  - User gets 1 streak freeze per 7-day period (resets every Monday at 00:00 user local time)
  - Opt-In Required: User must enable in Settings → Streaks & Progress → "Streak Freeze" [Toggle ON]
  - Rationale: Avoid dark pattern pressure ("must complete protocol today or lose streak")
  - Ethical Design: Freeze is NOT a paid feature; available to all users (Free, Core, Pro, Elite tiers)

REFILL_STREAK_FREEZE (Cloud Function, triggers every Monday at 00:00 user local time):
  FOR each user WHERE streak_freeze_opted_in = TRUE:
    User_Streak_Freeze_Available = TRUE
    User_Streak_Freeze_Used_Date = NULL

    Log: "Streak freeze refilled for user [user_id]"
```

**Milestone Badges:**

```
BADGES:
  - 7 days: "Week Warrior 🔥" (bronze badge, visual: small flame icon)
  - 14 days: "Two-Week Titan 💪" (silver badge, visual: flexed bicep)
  - 30 days: "Monthly Maven 🏆" (gold badge, visual: trophy)
  - 60 days: "Consistency King/Queen 👑" (platinum badge, visual: crown)
  - 100 days: "Legend Status 🚀" (diamond badge, visual: rocket)
  - 365 days: "Year of Excellence ⭐" (cosmic badge, visual: star burst)

UNLOCK_LOGIC:
  FUNCTION CHECK_MILESTONE_BADGES(current_streak):
    milestone_thresholds = [7, 14, 30, 60, 100, 365]

    FOR threshold IN milestone_thresholds:
      IF current_streak = threshold AND badge_unlocked(threshold) = FALSE:
        // Unlock badge
        INSERT INTO user_badges (user_id, badge_id, unlocked_at) VALUES (current_user, threshold_badge, NOW())

        // Show celebration modal (React Native Lottie animation)
        SHOW_CELEBRATION_MODAL(
          animation: "confetti_burst.json",

        // Log event for analytics
        LOG_EVENT("Badge_Unlocked", {badge_id: threshold, streak: current_streak, timestamp: NOW()})
```

**Streak Repair (One-Time Grace for Long Streaks):**

```
STREAK_REPAIR (One-time offer for streaks ≥30 days):
  FUNCTION ON_STREAK_BREAK(previous_streak):
    IF previous_streak >= 30 AND User_Lifetime_Streak_Repairs = 0:
      // Offer one-time repair
      SHOW_MODAL(
        title: "Your {previous_streak}-day streak ended yesterday 😔",
        body: "You've built an incredible routine. Want to restore your streak? You get 1 free streak repair (one-time only).",
        cta_primary: "Restore Streak (Free)",
        cta_secondary: "Start Fresh",
        illustration: "streak_repair_offer.png"
      )

      // If user taps "Restore Streak":
      ON_RESTORE_CLICK:
        // Restore streak to previous_streak
        User_Current_Streak = previous_streak
        User_Lifetime_Streak_Repairs += 1  // Mark as used (can't use again)

        // Update database
        UPDATE users_streak_state SET
          current_streak = previous_streak,

        )

        // Log event
        LOG_EVENT("Streak_Repaired", {previous_streak, timestamp: NOW()})
```

### 2.2 Private Challenges (Friends-Only)

**Challenge Structure:**

```
PRIVATE_CHALLENGE_RULES:
  - Initiate custom or template challenges (7, 30-day cycles; 2–10 friends)
  - Invites via SMS, email, or code; challenge auto-starts once ≥2 accept
  - Daily check-in: [Yes/No] + optional proof (upload/photo/wearable sync)
  - Leaderboard ranks by completion rate; show only rank, not failures
  - End-of-challenge message: "Great effort! X days done. Want a rematch?"

CHALLENGE_DURATION_TIERS:
  - Sprints: 7-day, 1 protocol, 5-day target (beginner)
  - Marathon: 30-day, up to 3 protocols, 25-day target (advanced)
  - Custom validated to avoid unrealistic targets
```

### 2.3 Anonymous Leaderboards

```
ANONYMOUS_LEADERBOARDS:
  - Global/city views, opt-in only; anonymous handles by default
  - Show top 10 + user's own rank; never show bottom ranks
  - If user opts-in, public profile shown
  - "You're #X in San Francisco, top Y%"

ANTI-SHAME_SAFEGUARDS:
  - Leaderboards never show lowest ranks; always positive progress framing
  - Challenge and streak loss framed as success percentage/personal best
  - Social comparison prompts collaboration ("Friend has 50-day streak! Want a challenge?")
```

### 2.4 Team Challenges (Collaborative)

```
TEAM_CHALLENGES:
  - Team size 5–10 users; collective goal (e.g., 100 protocols/7 days)
  - Real-time team progress bar with nudges when behind pace
  - Reward badge + unlock protocol on success

TEAM_PROGRESS_LOGIC:
  IF team_total_protocols < (goal_protocols * 0.5) AND days_remaining <= 3:
    SEND_TEAM_NUDGE("Your team is behind pace. 15 protocols to goal!")
```

### 2.5 Share Cards (Social Virality)

```
SHARE_CARD_GENERATION:
  - Auto-generate milestone graphics: branded, protocol name, days, optional avatar
  - Shareable via system sheet (Instagram/TikTok/Twitter)
  - No biometric/private data, only streak counts/protocols
  - Referral code embedded; tracked for Pro tier reward

SHARE_BADGE_TO_INSTAGRAM:
  FUNCTION ON_BADGE_SHARE_CLICK(badge_id):
    // Step 1: Generate share card image (Canvas API)
    share_card = GENERATE_SHARE_CARD(
      template: "gradient_background.png",  // Brand colors gradient
      text: "🔥 {badge.name} on Wellness OS\nEvidence into action.\n{current_streak}-day streak",
      badge_image: badge.image,
      logo: "wellnessos_logo_white.png",
      size: {width: 1080, height: 1920}  // Instagram story dimensions
    )

    // Step 2: Add App Store link overlay
    share_card = ADD_TEXT_OVERLAY(
      text: "Download: wellnessos.app",
      position: "bottom",
      font_size: 24
    )

    // Step 3: Save to device
    file_path = SAVE_TO_DEVICE(share_card, "wellnessos_badge.png")

    // Step 4: Open Instagram share sheet (platform-specific)
    IF platform = "iOS":
      OPEN_SHARE_SHEET(
        items: [file_path],
        activities: ["Instagram Stories", "Instagram Feed", "More"]
      )
    ELSE IF platform = "Android":
      OPEN_SHARE_INTENT(
        type: "image/png",
        file_path: file_path,
        package: "com.instagram.android"
      )

    // Step 5: Log event
    LOG_EVENT("Badge_Shared", {badge_id, platform, timestamp: NOW()})
```

### 2.6 Content Moderation & Community Guidelines

```
CONTENT_MODERATION_RULES:
  - Guidelines: celebrate progress, forbid shaming, medical advice, spam
  - Reporting: tap "⚠️ Report", multi-type reason, 24h admin review
  - Enforcement: warning → 7-day ban → permanent ban
  - AI (GPT-4 or equivalent) flags toxic phrases; all flagged content reviewed before ban

INVITE_MECHANICS:
  - Challenges: link or SMS invite, max 10/user, public (any join via code, max 100) vs. private
```

## 3. Onboarding & First Run Experience

### 3.1 Onboarding Flow State Machine

```
STATE 0: Pre-Signup Landing Page (Optional)
  - Show: "AI coaching for sleep & light. Evidence-backed. 5-minute setup."
  - Friction: Minimal—single CTA: "Get Started"
  - No questions asked

STATE 1: Account Creation (Target: <60 seconds)
  - Collect:
    - Email address
    - Password OR Social OAuth (Google, Apple)
    - Optional: Display Name (for social features)
  - Do NOT ask: Age, wearables, protocols, health data
  - Do NOT show: Permissions requests
  - SUCCESS → STATE 2

STATE 2: Core Profile (Target: <120 seconds)
  - Collect exactly 3 questions:
    Q1: "What's your primary wellness goal?" [Sleep, Energy, Focus, Stress, Performance]
    Q2: "When do you usually wake up?" [Time picker; use local time]
    Q3: "Do you use any wearables?" [Yes/No → if Yes, list: Apple Watch, Oura, Whoop, Fitbit, Other]
  - Store responses: {goal, wake_time, has_wearables}
  - Logic:
    - IF goal == "Sleep" THEN assign Sleep Foundation protocols (Morning Light, Evening Light, Sleep Optimization)
    - IF goal == "Energy" THEN assign Energy Stack protocols (Morning Light, Caffeine Cutoff, Movement)
    - IF goal == "Focus" THEN assign Focus protocols (Morning Light, Blue Light Cutoff, Wind-Down)
    - IF wake_time AND timezone THEN calculate_bedtime = wake_time - 8.5 hours (average sleep duration)
  - Do NOT ask follow-up questions in this state
  - SUCCESS → STATE 3

STATE 3: First Win Delivery (Target: <180 seconds total from signup)
  - Trigger personalized protocol nudge within 5 minutes of signup completion
  - Example nudge generation:
    - IF current_time < wake_time + 60 min AND current_date is weekday THEN show: "Morning Light Exposure"
    - Content: 1 sentence description + 1 DOI citation (e.g., "Bright light in morning boosts alertness [DOI:10.1038/nrn2622]")
    - Call-to-action: "Start Now" (leads to protocol guidance) OR "Later" (schedules reminder)
  - Display success animation or acknowledgment
  - Show progress bar: "You're 1/3 done with your first protocol!"
  - SUCCESS → STATE 4

STATE 4: Welcome & Next Steps (Target: <30 seconds)
  - Show: "Your personalized plan is ready. Check back tomorrow for your next nudge."
  - Optional: Preview of Day 2-3 protocols (1-sentence teasers)
  - OPTIONAL: Soft prompt for wearable connection ("Add your wearable for even smarter coaching" with X to dismiss)
  - Onboarding marked complete
  - Route to Home Tab
```

**Permission Request Timing:**

```
PERMISSION: Notifications
  - TRIGGER: After first protocol nudge is viewed by user (typically Day 1, post-onboarding)
  - CONTEXT: "Get nudges matched to your schedule"
  - Implementation: Present permission dialog with brief explanation
  - IF denied: Use in-app only (no push notifications)

PERMISSION: Health Data (HealthKit/Google Fit)
  - TRIGGER: Day 2-3, or when user first connects wearable
  - CONTEXT: "Sync sleep data from your phone to refine coaching"
  - Implementation: Permission request + "Why We Ask" explainer
  - IF denied: Manual logging available as fallback

PERMISSION: Location (for sunrise/sunset calculation)
  - TRIGGER: After first Morning Light protocol assigned (Day 1 or Day 2)
  - CONTEXT: "Accurate sunrise times for your location"
  - Implementation: Permission request with clear rationale
  - IF denied: Use timezone-based estimates (fallback logic)
```

### 3.2 Progressive Profiling Schedule (Days 2-14)

```
DAY 2: After first protocol completion or 24 hours since signup
  - Trigger: User completes first protocol (or time-based if no completion)
  - Question 1: "How did that feel?" [Scale: 1-5, from Too Easy to Too Hard]
  - Question 2: (Conditional on Q1 response)
    - IF Q1 <= 2 → "Want a more challenging version tomorrow?"
    - IF Q1 >= 4 → "Want us to dial it back?"
  - Action: Update difficulty_preference in profile
  - Timing: In-app modal after nudge view or check-in, not intrusive

DAY 3: After 2 consecutive days of protocol adherence
  - Trigger: user.protocol_adherence_streak >= 2
  - Question: "Which of these interests you? (Select all)" [Nutrition, Cold Exposure, NSDR, Movement]
  - Action: Pre-populate Day 4 protocol assignment based on selection
  - Timing: End-of-day notification or next morning

DAY 5: Mid-week check-in (if weekday signup)
  - Question: "How's your sleep been? (1-10 scale)"
  - Secondary: "Any barriers to your routine?" [Open-ended, 1-2 sentences]
  - Action: Store baseline sleep rating; flag open-ended feedback for Adaptive Coach
  - Timing: Brief modal, mid-day

DAY 7: After first 7-day streak
  - Trigger: user.protocol_adherence_streak >= 7
  - Celebration: Animated badge, "7-Day Streak! 🔥"
  - Question 1: "Ready to add a second protocol?" [Yes/No]
  - Question 2 (if Yes): Present 3 suggested protocols based on goal + engagement
  - Question 3 (Optional): "Want to share your streak with a friend?" [Opt-in social]
  - Action: Enable second protocol in user's routine; capture display_name if social share selected
  - Timing: Celebration modal, Day 7 evening or Day 8 morning

DAY 10: After 10 days of app usage
  - Trigger: days_since_signup >= 10 AND app_sessions >= 10
  - Question: "How's your energy/sleep/focus?" [Scale 1-10] (matches user's original goal)
  - Secondary: "Any changes since you started?" [Multiple choice: Better, Same, Worse, Too soon to tell]
  - Action: Store baseline metric for Day 30 comparison; trigger Adaptive Coach insights if data supports hypothesis
  - Timing: In-app survey, non-intrusive

DAY 14: Onboarding completion
  - Status: profile_completion_percentage calculation
  - Show: "Your profile is 80% complete. Tell us more to unlock personalized insights."
  - Optional deep-dive: Link to full profile editor (demographics, health history, timezone, preferences)

- Time-to-first-win: <5 minutes (protocol nudge shown)
- D1 Activation: ≥60% (first protocol completed within 24h)
- Users completing onboarding in <3 minutes see 2x higher Day 7 retention
- Tailored onboarding paths increase Day 30 retention by 52%
- Push notification permission after first nudge: 47% boost vs. onboarding request (22-30%)

## 4. Gamification & Progress Mechanics

### 4.1 XP System (Overall User Level, Non-Linear Progression)

```
XP_SYSTEM (Overall User Level, separate from Protocol Mastery):
  - Each protocol completion = +10 XP
  - Daily streak bonus: +5 XP per day on current streak (e.g., 30-day streak = +150 XP bonus once)

  Level thresholds (non-linear):
    - Level 1 → 2: 50 XP (5 protocols, ~5 days)
    - Level 2 → 3: 100 XP (10 protocols, ~10 days)
    - Level 3 → 4: 200 XP (20 protocols, ~20 days)
    - Level 4 → 5: 400 XP (40 protocols, ~40 days)
    - Level 5 → 6: 800 XP (80 protocols, ~80 days)

  Rationale:
    - Early levels fast (quick wins during habit formation, Days 1-30)
    - Later levels slower (sustained engagement, signals mastery)
    - 2x scaling factor (each level requires 2x XP of previous level)

CALCULATE_USER_LEVEL:
  FUNCTION GET_USER_LEVEL(total_xp):
    IF total_xp >= 800:
      RETURN 6
    ELSE IF total_xp >= 400:
      RETURN 5
    ELSE IF total_xp >= 200:
      RETURN 4
    ELSE IF total_xp >= 100:
      RETURN 3
    ELSE IF total_xp >= 50:
      RETURN 2
    ELSE:
      RETURN 1

// Display (Home Screen):

    body: "You've reached Level {new_level}. Keep building your wellness routine!",
    cta: "Continue"
  )
```

### 4.2 Protocol Mastery Progression

```
MASTERY_LEVELS (Per Protocol, e.g., Morning Light, Caffeine Cutoff, Wind-Down):
  - Level 1 (Beginner): 1-6 completions
  - Level 2 (Intermediate): 7-20 completions
  - Level 3 (Advanced): 21-49 completions
  - Level 4 (Master): 50+ completions

DISPLAY:
  // Protocol card shows mastery level + completion count
  <ProtocolCard>
    <ProtocolTitle>Morning Light Protocol</ProtocolTitle>
    <MasteryLevel>Level 3 (Advanced) — 25 completions</MasteryLevel>
    <ProgressBar value={25} max={49} nextLevel="Master" />
  </ProtocolCard>

LEVEL_UP_CELEBRATION:
  FUNCTION ON_PROTOCOL_COMPLETION(protocol_id):
    // Increment completion count
    protocol_completion_count = COUNT(protocol_completions WHERE protocol_id = protocol_id AND user_id = current_user)

    // Check if level threshold crossed
    new_level = CALCULATE_MASTERY_LEVEL(protocol_completion_count)
    previous_level = GET_PREVIOUS_LEVEL(protocol_id)

    IF new_level > previous_level:
      // Show level-up toast
      SHOW_TOAST(
        message: "Level up! [Protocol Name] → [new_level] 🎉",
        duration: 3000,  // 3 seconds
        position: "bottom"
      )

      // Update database
      UPDATE protocol_mastery_levels SET level = new_level WHERE protocol_id = protocol_id AND user_id = current_user

      // Log event
      LOG_EVENT("Protocol_Level_Up", {protocol_id, new_level, completions: protocol_completion_count})

// Mastery level calculation function:
FUNCTION CALCULATE_MASTERY_LEVEL(completions):
  IF completions >= 50:
    RETURN "Master"
  ELSE IF completions >= 21:
    RETURN "Advanced"
  ELSE IF completions >= 7:
    RETURN "Intermediate"
  ELSE:
    RETURN "Beginner"
```

### 4.3 Unlockable Content (Intrinsic Rewards)

```
UNLOCK_TRIGGERS (Streak-based feature unlocks):
  - 30-day streak → Unlock "NSDR Module" (normally Month 2+ feature, early access reward)
  - 60-day streak → Unlock "Custom Protocol Builder" (Pro-tier feature, 1-month free trial)
  - 100-day streak → Unlock "Elite Tier Free Trial (1 month)" (includes labs, genetics, expert calls)

UNLOCK_NOTIFICATION (On day streak milestone is reached):
  FUNCTION CHECK_STREAK_UNLOCK(current_streak):
    unlock_thresholds = {
      30: {feature: "NSDR Module", description: "20-min guided NSDR sessions to accelerate recovery"},
      60: {feature: "Custom Protocol Builder", description: "Design your own protocols based on your unique goals"},
      100: {feature: "Elite Tier (1 month)", description: "Full access: labs, genetics, expert calls"}
    }

    IF current_streak IN unlock_thresholds.keys() AND feature_unlocked(current_streak) = FALSE:
      unlock_data = unlock_thresholds[current_streak]

      // Show modal
      SHOW_MODAL(
        title: "🎁 You've unlocked [unlock_data.feature]!",
        body: "Your [current_streak]-day streak earned this. [unlock_data.description]",
        cta: "Explore Now",
        action_url: get_feature_url(unlock_data.feature)
      )

      // Update database

      // Send email
      SEND_EMAIL(
        subject: "🎁 New Feature Unlocked!",

        cta_button: "Try It Now",
        cta_url: get_feature_url(unlock_data.feature)
      )

      // Log event
      LOG_EVENT("Feature_Unlocked", {feature: unlock_data.feature, streak: current_streak, unlock_type: "streak_reward"})
```

### 4.4 Variable Reward Schedule (Surprise Unlocks)

```
RANDOM_REWARDS (10% chance on protocol completion):
  FUNCTION ON_PROTOCOL_COMPLETION(protocol_id):
    // Roll random number
    random_roll = RANDOM_FLOAT(0, 1)  // Random float between 0 and 1

    IF random_roll < 0.10:  // 10% probability
      // Select random reward type
      reward_types = [
        {type: "insight", title: "Insight of the Day 💡", content: GET_RANDOM_EVIDENCE_INSIGHT()},
        {type: "bonus_protocol", title: "Bonus Protocol Unlock 🎁", content: "1-day trial of Cold Exposure Protocol"},
        {type: "share_template", title: "New Share Card 📸", content: "Unlock Instagram story template: 'Science-Backed Sleep'"}
      ]

      selected_reward = RANDOM_CHOICE(reward_types)

      // Show surprise modal
      SHOW_MODAL(
        animation: "surprise_gift.json",  // Lottie animation
        title: "Surprise! 🎁",
        body: selected_reward.content,
        cta: "Awesome!",
        action_url: get_reward_url(selected_reward)
      )

      // Log event
      LOG_EVENT("Variable_Reward_Triggered", {reward_type: selected_reward.type, protocol_id})

// Evidence-backed insights pool (examples):
EVIDENCE_INSIGHTS = [
  "Morning light exposure increases alertness by 50% within 10 minutes (Cajochen et al., 2005)",
  "Caffeine has a half-life of 5-6 hours, so an 8pm coffee still has 25% caffeine at 2am (Drake et al., 2013)",
  "10-20 min NSDR can replace 1 hour of sleep for cognitive recovery (Paller & Oudiette, 2018)",
  "Cold exposure (11°C water, 3 min) increases dopamine by 250% for 2+ hours (Šrámek et al., 2000)",
  "Wind-down routines reduce sleep onset time by 40% on average (Irish et al., 2015)"
]
```

### 4.5 Immediate Rewards (Confetti Animation)

```
ON_PROTOCOL_COMPLETION (Every protocol completion triggers immediate feedback):
  FUNCTION MARK_PROTOCOL_COMPLETE(protocol_id):
    // Step 1: Update database
    INSERT INTO protocol_completions (user_id, protocol_id, completed_at) VALUES (current_user, protocol_id, NOW())

    // Step 2: Show confetti animation (React Native Lottie)
    PLAY_LOTTIE_ANIMATION(
      animation: "confetti_burst.json",
      duration: 2000,  // 2 seconds
      loop: false
    )

    // Step 3: Play satisfying sound effect
    PLAY_SOUND(
      file: "success_ding.mp3",
      volume: 0.8
    )

    // Step 4: Update streak count with animated tick-up
    UPDATE_STREAK_COUNT_WITH_ANIMATION(
      from: current_streak,
      to: current_streak + 1,
      duration: 1000  // 1 second
    )

    // Step 5: Show motivational toast
    SHOW_TOAST(
      message: "Protocol complete! 🎉 Streak: [current_streak + 1] days",
      duration: 3000,
      position: "bottom"
    )

    // Step 6: Check for variable reward trigger (10% chance)
    CHECK_VARIABLE_REWARD()
```

### 4.6 Plateau Mitigation

```
PLATEAU_DETECTION (Cloud Function, runs daily):
  FUNCTION CHECK_USER_PLATEAU():
    FOR each user:
      days_at_current_level = DAYS_SINCE(user_level_up_date)

      IF days_at_current_level >= 14:
        // User stuck at same level for ≥14 days
        // Send tip to accelerate progress

        // Identify protocols user hasn't tried yet
        untried_protocols = GET_PROTOCOLS_NOT_COMPLETED(user_id)
        suggested_protocol = RANDOM_CHOICE(untried_protocols)

        SEND_NOTIFICATION(
          title: "Level Up Faster 💡",
          body: "You've been at Level {user_level} for 14 days. Try adding {suggested_protocol.name} to level up faster! [Explore Protocol]",
          action_url: "/protocols/{suggested_protocol.id}"
        )

        // Log event
        LOG_EVENT("Plateau_Tip_Sent", {user_level, days_at_level: days_at_current_level, suggested_protocol})

// Alternative tips (rotate weekly):
PLATEAU_TIPS = [
  "Try adding a new protocol (NSDR, Cold Exposure) to level up faster!",
  "Complete protocols 2x per day to earn XP faster. Morning + Evening Wind-Down = +20 XP/day.",
  "Your current streak is {current_streak} days. Aim for 30 days to unlock NSDR Module!",
  "Pro tip: Complete harder protocols (NSDR, Cold Exposure) for bonus XP. [Upgrade to Pro]"
]
```

### 4.7 Anti-Manipulation Safeguards

```
SAFEGUARD RULES:

1. NO LOSS FRAMING:
   ❌ NEVER say: "Your streak died!", "You lost everything!", "Streak broken 💔"
   ✅ INSTEAD say: "Your 15-day streak paused. Your longest streak (15 days) is still preserved. [Start New Streak]"

2. NO PAY-TO-WIN:
   - CANNOT buy streak restoration with real money (no "Pay $4.99 to restore your streak" option)
   - CANNOT buy XP boosts with real money (no "Buy 500 XP for $9.99")
   - CANNOT buy badges with real money (no "Unlock all badges for $19.99")
   - Rewards are ONLY earned through protocol adherence (time investment, not money)

3. NO ARTIFICIAL SCARCITY:
   ❌ NEVER say: "Only 24 hours left to save your streak!" (creates anxiety)
   ❌ NEVER say: "This badge is only available today!" (false urgency)
   ✅ INSTEAD: Streak freeze is always available (1 per week, no urgency messaging)

4. OPT-OUT MECHANISM:
   Settings → Gamification → "Hide Streaks & Badges" [Toggle ON]

   IF User_Gamification_Hidden = TRUE:
     - Hide all streak counters (current_streak, longest_streak)
     - Hide all badges (don't display badge grid on profile)
     - Hide XP bars (don't show user_level, xp_progress)
     - Show plain protocol list (no mastery levels, no confetti animations)
     - Rationale: Some users find streaks/badges stressful; respect their autonomy
```

**Research Support:**

- Loss aversion: Users at risk of losing highest level were 18.40% more likely to meet step goals (602-participant trial)
- Duolingo streak freeze increased daily active learners by 0.38% by reducing anxiety
- Milestone animations increase engagement by up to 70%
- 7-day streak users are 60% less likely to churn vs. Day 1 users
- Variable rewards trigger dopamine "hunting state" via unpredictability
- Badge inflation reduces value: Only award badges for meaningful accomplishments (not "You logged in!")

## 5. Notification & Nudge Delivery System

### 5.1 Local vs. Remote Notification Strategy

**Local Notifications (Preferred for Protocol Nudges):**

```
USE FOR: Morning light exposure, caffeine cutoff timing, evening wind-down routines

SCHEDULE: Daily at midnight UTC, calculate next 24 hours of nudge times → schedule all local notifications

ADVANTAGE: Works offline, zero server dependency, instant delivery at exact time

iOS IMPLEMENTATION:
import UserNotifications

// Request permission (show once on app first launch)
UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .sound, .badge]) { granted, error in
    if granted {
        print("Notification permission granted")
    }
}

// Schedule morning light nudge
let content = UNMutableNotificationContent()
content.title = "🌅 Morning Light Time"
content.body = "10 min of sunlight = better sleep tonight. Let's go!"
content.sound = UNNotificationSound.default
content.categoryIdentifier = "PROTOCOL_NUDGE"
content.userInfo = ["protocol_id": "morning_light_exposure", "trigger_source": "adaptive_coach"]

// Trigger at user's preferred wake time + 15 minutes
var dateComponents = DateComponents()
dateComponents.hour = user.wakeTime.hour + 0
dateComponents.minute = user.wakeTime.minute + 15
let trigger = UNCalendarNotificationTrigger(dateMatching: dateComponents, repeats: true)

let request = UNNotificationRequest(identifier: "morning_light_daily", content: content, trigger: trigger)
UNUserNotificationCenter.current().add(request)

ANDROID IMPLEMENTATION:
import android.app.NotificationChannel
import android.app.NotificationManager
import androidx.core.app.NotificationCompat

// Create notification channel (once on app launch)
val channel = NotificationChannel(
    "protocol_nudges",
    "Protocol Nudges",
    NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_HIGH
).apply {
    description = "Science-backed wellness nudges at optimal times"
}
val notificationManager = getSystemService(NotificationManager::class.java)
notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(channel)

// Schedule morning light nudge
val notification = NotificationCompat.Builder(this, "protocol_nudges")
    .setContentTitle("🌅 Morning Light Time")
    .setContentText("10 min of sunlight = better sleep tonight. Let's go!")
    .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_sun_notification)
    .setPriority(NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_HIGH)
    .setCategory(NotificationCompat.CATEGORY_REMINDER)
    .build()

notificationManager.notify(1001, notification)
```

**Remote Push (Firebase Cloud Messaging):**

```
USE FOR: Social updates (friend completed challenge), system alerts (wearable disconnected), re-engagement campaigns (7-day inactive user)

ADVANTAGE: Real-time delivery, can update content after app exit, server-controlled logic

LIMITATION: Requires network connection, FCM delivery not guaranteed (especially Android Doze mode)
```

### 5.2 Notification Frequency Limits by User Tier

```
MAX_NOTIFICATIONS_PER_DAY:
  - Free Tier: 2 notifications/day (protocol nudges only)
  - Core Tier: 3 notifications/day (adds daily check-ins)
  - Pro Tier: 4 notifications/day (adds social updates)
  - Elite Tier: 6 notifications/day (adds custom protocol reminders)

ENFORCEMENT_LOGIC:
  - Track daily_notification_count in Firestore: users/{user_id}/notification_stats/{date}
  - BEFORE scheduling any notification:
    IF daily_notification_count >= MAX_FOR_TIER:
      SKIP notification
      Log: "Daily limit reached for user {user_id}, tier {tier_level}"
    ELSE:
      Send notification
      INCREMENT daily_notification_count
```

### 5.3 Quiet Hours Enforcement

```
DEFAULT_QUIET_HOURS:
  - Start: 22:00 user local timezone
  - End: 06:00 user local timezone
  - User Override: Settings → Notifications → "Quiet Hours" [Toggle OFF]

BEFORE_SCHEDULING_LOGIC:
  notification_time = calculate_user_local_time(notification_utc)
  IF notification_time BETWEEN 22:00 AND 06:00:
    IF user.quiet_hours_enabled == true:
      SKIP notification
      Log: "Notification suppressed (quiet hours): {notification_id}"
    ELSE:
      SCHEDULE notification
```

### 5.4 Priority Levels and Batching Rules

```
PRIORITY_LEVELS:
  - CRITICAL: Protocol nudges at circadian-optimal times (Morning Light 7:15AM, Caffeine Cutoff calculated from bedtime)
    → Deliver immediately, no batching, use high platform priority
    → iOS: Critical Alert eligibility for approved health apps
    → Android: IMPORTANCE_HIGH channel

  - IMPORTANT: Daily wellness check-ins, habit recovery prompts ("3 missed days - restart tomorrow?")
    → Deliver immediately but respect quiet hours
    → iOS: UNNotificationPresentationOptions [.banner, .sound]
    → Android: IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT channel

  - LOW: Social updates, share card likes, friend activity
    → BATCH: Group all LOW priority from past 12 hours
    → Send once daily at 17:00 user local time
    → Combined message: "3 updates: Alice completed a challenge, Bob liked your share card + 1 more"

BATCHING_IMPLEMENTATION:
  IF 2+ LOW priority notifications pending:
    batch_message = generate_summary(pending_low_priority_notifications)
    notification_content = batch_message
    notification_data = {"notification_ids": [array_of_batched_ids]}
```

### 5.5 Do Not Disturb Integration

**iOS Focus Mode Detection:**

```swift
import UserNotifications

// Check notification authorization (iOS handles Focus mode automatically)
UNUserNotificationCenter.current().getNotificationSettings { settings in
    if settings.authorizationStatus == .authorized {
        // iOS will respect Focus mode settings automatically
        // App cannot override Focus mode (by design for user privacy)
        scheduleNotification()
    }
}

// For Critical Alerts (requires Apple approval):
content.interruptionLevel = .critical  // iOS 15+
content.sound = UNNotificationSound.criticalAlert(named: "critical_health.caf")
```

**Android DND Detection:**

```kotlin
val notificationManager = getSystemService(NotificationManager::class.java)
val dndFilter = notificationManager.currentInterruptionFilter

when (dndFilter) {
    NotificationManager.INTERRUPTION_FILTER_NONE -> {
        // DND active → deliver silently
        notification.setSound(null)
        notification.setVibrate(null)
        notification.priority = NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_LOW
    }
    NotificationManager.INTERRUPTION_FILTER_PRIORITY -> {
        // Priority DND → check if health app is whitelisted
        if (isHealthAppAllowedInPriorityMode()) {
            notification.priority = NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_HIGH
        } else {
            notification.setSound(null)
        }
    }
    else -> {
        // Normal mode → full notification
        notification.priority = NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_HIGH
    }
}
```

### 5.6 Adaptive Spacing (Reduce Frequency Based on User Dismissals)

```
DISMISSAL_TRACKING:
  - Track notification outcome: OPENED, DISMISSED, IGNORED (no interaction within 1 hour)
  - Store in Firestore: users/{user_id}/notification_engagement/{protocol_id}
  - Calculate dismissal_rate = DISMISSED / (OPENED + DISMISSED) over last 7 days

ADAPTIVE_FREQUENCY_LOGIC:
  IF dismissal_rate >= 0.7 for same protocol over 7 days:
    REDUCE frequency by 50%:
      Daily → Every other day
      3x/week → 2x/week
      2x/week → 1x/week
    SEND recovery message: "Taking a break from {Protocol}. I'll check in less often until you're ready."

  IF user.opens_notification AND completes_protocol:
    RESET adaptive_spacing for that protocol
    RESUME original frequency
```

### 5.7 Notification Action Buttons (iOS)

```swift
// Define actionable notifications
let completeAction = UNNotificationAction(
    identifier: "COMPLETE_PROTOCOL",
    title: "Completed ✓",
    options: [.foreground]  // Opens app
)

let snoozeAction = UNNotificationAction(
    identifier: "SNOOZE_15MIN",
    title: "Remind me in 15 min",
    options: []  // Background action
)

let skipAction = UNNotificationAction(
    identifier: "SKIP_TODAY",
    title: "Skip Today",
    options: [.destructive]  // Red color
)

let category = UNNotificationCategory(
    identifier: "PROTOCOL_NUDGE",
    actions: [completeAction, snoozeAction, skipAction],
    intentIdentifiers: [],
    options: [.customDismissAction]
)

UNUserNotificationCenter.current().setNotificationCategories([category])
```

**Research Support:**

- Notifications ≤10 words achieve 2x higher click rates
- Mobile app users switch screens every 47 seconds (down from 2.5 min in 2004)
- Platform-specific: Notifications <25 chars see 50% higher open rates
- 2-4 notifications/day optimal for health apps; higher frequencies tolerated when contextually relevant
- 81% of users actively change notification settings when annoyed
- Users receiving 1 relevant notification show 147% increase in retention vs. zero notifications
- iOS Focus mode blocks notifications unless app explicitly allowed (users must manually add)
- Android Doze mode can delay notifications by hours without setExactAndAllowWhileIdle()

---

## 6. Habit Formation & Long-Term Engagement

### 6.1 Lapse Detection Algorithm

```
LAPSE_DEFINITION:
  - Lapse occurs when EITHER:
    a) user misses 2 consecutive days of ANY active protocol, OR
    b) adherence_rate < 4 days/week for 2 consecutive weeks

LAPSE_DETECTION_SERVICE (Runs Daily at 11:59 PM UTC):
  1. Query `adherence_events` table for past 14 days
  2. For each user with active_protocol_count > 0:
     - Calculate: missed_consecutive_days = max consecutive days with 0 protocol logs
     - Calculate: weekly_adherence = days_with_any_protocol_log / 7 for past 2 weeks
     - IF missed_consecutive_days >= 2 OR (weekly_adherence < 4/7 for 2 weeks):
       - Set user.lapse_level = LEVEL_1 (if first lapse in 30 days) OR LEVEL_2/3
       - Emit: LapseDetectedEvent(user_id, lapse_level, trigger_reason)
       - Increment: user.lapse_count_30_days += 1

LAPSE_LEVEL_ESCALATION:
  - LEVEL_1 (Minor): First or isolated lapse
    - Trigger: Send re-engagement nudge within 24 hours
    - Tone: Curious, light ("Hey, noticed a gap—what's going on?")
    - Next escalation: IF user does not respond AND lapse persists 3+ days → LEVEL_2

  - LEVEL_2 (Moderate): 2+ lapses in 30 days OR adherence <4 days/week for 2 weeks
    - Trigger: Send protocol simplification offer within 24 hours
    - Tone: Empathetic, agency-focused ("Life gets hectic. Want to simplify?")
    - Action: Offer to reduce active_protocol_count by 50%
    - Next escalation: IF user lapses 5+ times in 30 days → LEVEL_3

  - LEVEL_3 (Severe): Inactive ≥7 consecutive days OR 5+ lapses in 30 days
    - Trigger: Send break offer + restart guidance within 48 hours
    - Tone: Permissive, zero-pressure ("No pressure. Take the time you need.")
    - Action: Offer "Pause Mode" (suspend all nudges for 14 days)
    - Escalation: After 14-day pause, send single re-engagement email offering return
```

### 6.2 Re-Engagement Nudge Sequence (LEVEL_1)

```
PUSH_NOTIFICATION (HOUR 24 after lapse detection):
  - Headline: "We miss you! What got in the way today?"
  - In-app Modal: Show 3 quick-tap response options:
    ◦ "😴 Too tired"
    ◦ "🤔 Forgot"
    ◦ "😕 Not feeling it"
  - Logic:
    - IF user taps response → log reason_code to user.lapse_reason_last
    - IF user taps "Too tired" → adjust next nudge_time to earlier or offer sleep coaching
    - IF user taps "Not feeling it" → offer motivation audit or protocol switch
    - IF user takes no action → proceed to HOUR 48

IN_APP_MESSAGE (HOUR 48 after lapse):
  - Title: "No judgment—let's reset"
  - Body: "Streaks are great, but life happens. Here's how to get back on track: [Protocol Name] takes [X minutes]. Start today?"
  - CTA Button: "Log today's protocol" (deep link to protocol logging screen)
  - Card Visual: Show progress bar (e.g., "7 of 30 days streak" in soft gray, not red/shame-inducing)

PUSH_NOTIFICATION (HOUR 72 after lapse):
  - Headline: "Just one protocol today—pick your favorite"
  - In-app Modal: Single-protocol picker (reduce choice paralysis):
    ◦ Show user's 2–3 most-adherent protocols
    ◦ Add: "This should take ~5 min"
  - Logic: IF user selects protocol → immediately present logging screen

EMAIL (HOUR 72, optional async channel):
  - Subject Line: "No judgment—let's reset" (mirror push tone)
  - Body:
    ◦ Personalization: [User's Name], we noticed you took a break from [Protocol].
    ◦ Empathy: "Life is unpredictable. The best habit is the one you restart."
    ◦ Action: "Log just one protocol in 2 minutes" (link to app with deep link)
    ◦ Incentive: "Restart your streak—you've got this."
  - Timing: Send only if user has opted into email AND has not re-engaged within 48 hours
```

### 6.3 Protocol Simplification Logic

```
SIMPLIFICATION_TRIGGER_1 (After 3+ lapses in 30 days):
  - IF user.lapse_count_30_days >= 3:
    - Calculate: protocols_ranked_by_adherence = sort(active_protocols by historical_completion_rate DESC)
    - Message: "Life gets hectic. Let's focus on your top [N] habits. Which [N] matter most right now?"
    - Action: Present user with top 2–3 protocols by adherence; allow selection
    - Logic:
      - IF user selects → set active_protocol_count to user selection
      - Emit: ProtocolSimplificationEvent(user_id, from_count, to_count, user_confirmed)
      - Update: protocol_lock_until = NOW + 7 days (prevent thrashing)
    - UI: Show "Simplified Mode" label; explain temporary scope

SIMPLIFICATION_TRIGGER_2 (After 5+ lapses in 30 days):
  - IF user.lapse_count_30_days >= 5:
    - Message: "Want to hit pause and restart with just one habit?"
    - Action: Offer "Reset Mode":
      - Pause all protocols for 3 days
      - On Day 4, present single protocol (user choice or system default: Morning Light)
      - Reduce active_protocol_count to 1
      - Set user.reset_mode = true until user re-engages 5+ days
    - Logic:
      - IF user accepts reset → pause_all_nudges_until = NOW + 3 days
      - Emit: ResetModeActivatedEvent(user_id, selected_protocol)
      - On Day 4: Send single nudge: "Ready to restart? We picked [Protocol] to help."

PROTOCOL_LOCK_DURATION:
  - After simplification, lock protocol changes for 7 days (prevent user thrashing)
  - After Day 7, allow re-expansion only if adherence >= 5/7 for 2 consecutive weeks
```

### 6.4 Tone Guidelines for Coach Responses

**Language to AVOID (Guilt/Shame-Inducing):**

```
❌ "You failed"
❌ "You need to try harder"
❌ "Your streak is broken"
❌ "Why can't you stick to this?"
❌ "Other users are crushing it—where are you?"
❌ "This is basic—everyone can do this"
❌ "You're letting yourself down"
```

**Language to USE (Curious, Compassionate, Agency-Focused):**

```
✓ "What got in the way?"
✓ "Let's adjust and try again"
✓ "Progress, not perfection"
✓ "What feels doable today?"
✓ "You're still learning what works for you"
✓ "We all have seasons. This is your reset."
✓ "You know what helps you best—let's listen to that"
✓ "What would make this easier?"
✓ "No judgment here—just curiosity"
```

**Behavioral Science Foundation:**

- **Self-Compassion Theory (Kristin Neff):** Self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness reduce relapse rates
- **Fogg Behavior Model:** Lapses occur when Motivation, Ability, or Prompt fails to align
- **Habit Formation Research:** 66 days average to establish habit (range 18-254 days); Days 1-14 most vulnerable
- **Complexity Reduction:** Single-protocol adherence 40-60% higher than multi-protocol adherence
- **Clinical Relapse Prevention:** 24-48h intervention window optimal; shame triggers avoidance/hiding
- **Target Metric:** 60% lapse recovery (return to ≥4 days/week adherence) within 14 days

**User Profile Schema Additions:**

## 7. Retention & Re-engagement Strategies

### 7.1 Celebration Moment Triggers

**TRIGGER 1: First Protocol Completion (Day 0-1)**

```
RULE: Every user sees "first protocol completion" celebration once and only once.

IF protocol_completion == TRUE
   AND user_celebrations.first_protocol_seen == FALSE
   THEN:

   - Show animation: "Confetti explosion" (2 seconds, Lottie JSON file)
     * File size: <50KB (verified lightweight for all devices)
     * Format: Lottie (iOS/Android/Web compatible)

   - Play sound: Subtle chime (200ms, optional, respect system mute preference)
     * IF user_settings.sound_enabled == TRUE:
       Play audio: /assets/sounds/celebration-chime.mp3
     * OTHERWISE: Silent (haptic feedback on Android via vibration API)

   - Copy: "First win! 🎉 You just completed your first protocol.
            Consistency builds the habit."

   - CTA Button 1: "Log tomorrow's protocol" (primary, deep link)
     * Action: navigate_to_tomorrow_protocol()

   - CTA Button 2: "View protocol details" (secondary)
     * Action: show_protocol_evidence_modal()

   - Analytics Event:
     * celebration_first_protocol
     * timestamp: NOW()
     * protocol_name: protocol.name
     * user_tier: user.tier

   - Mark flag: user_celebrations.first_protocol_seen = TRUE
```

**TRIGGER 2: 3-Day Streak (Day 2-3)**

```
RULE: Display once when user.streak_count == 3.

IF user.streak_count == 3
   AND user_celebrations.streak_3_seen == FALSE
   THEN:

   - Show animation: "Flame icon scales up 1.5x" (1.5 seconds)
     * Icon color: From gray → orange → gold (CSS transition)
     * Easing: ease-out (feels impactful, not bouncy)

   - Copy: "🔥 3 days strong! Consistency is building your new habit.
            Your brain is rewiring—keep it up!"

   - CTA: "See your streak calendar" (link to streaks view)
     * Action: navigate_to_streaks_view()

   - Analytics: celebration_3_day_streak

   - No upgrade prompt at this stage (too early, would feel pushy)
```

**TRIGGER 3: 7-Day Streak (Week 1 Complete) — UPGRADE TRIGGER MOMENT #1**

```
RULE: This is the FIRST upgrade trigger. Celebrate first, pause, then offer upgrade.

IF user.streak_count == 7
   AND user_celebrations.streak_7_seen == FALSE
   AND user.tier == "free"
   THEN:

   - Step 1: Show celebration (2 seconds)
     * Animation: "Badge unlock: '7-Day Warrior' badge"
       - 3D rotating badge with particle effects (Rive animation, <100KB)
       - Sound: +200 XP "ding" sound (if enabled)
     * Copy: "One week in! 🏆 You're in the top 20% of new users.
              Your consistency streak is now saved."

   - Step 2: Wait 2-3 seconds (let user enjoy the win)
     * setTimeout(() => { showUpgradePrompt() }, 2500)

   - Step 3: Show upgrade prompt (non-intrusive modal)
     * Headline: "Ready to level up? ⬆️"
     * Copy: "You're crushing it! Unlock personalized coaching
             & advanced analytics to see how your habits impact
             your energy, focus, and sleep quality."
     * CTA: "Start 7-day free trial" (primary button)
       - No credit card required for Free → Core trial
       - Action: navigate_to_trial_onboarding()
     * Secondary CTA: "Maybe later" (dismiss, no penalty)

   - Analytics:
     * celebration_7_day_streak
     * paywall_7_day_streak_view
     * IF user taps "Start trial":
       - paywall_7_day_streak_conversion
       - user.trial_start_date = NOW()
       - user.trial_end_date = NOW() + 7 days
       - user.tier = "core" (proactive, with trial flag)
     * IF user dismisses:
       - paywall_7_day_streak_dismissal
       - Schedule retry: show again after +3 days if streak continues

   - Mark flag: user_celebrations.streak_7_seen = TRUE
```

**TRIGGER 4: 30-Day Streak (Month 1 Complete) — UPGRADE TRIGGER MOMENT #2**

```
RULE: For Core users, upgrade to Pro. For Free users who didn't convert at Day 7,
      show Core upgrade again with social proof.

IF user.streak_count == 30
   AND user_celebrations.streak_30_seen == FALSE
   THEN:

   - Show celebration (3 seconds)
     * Animation: "Trophy unlock: 3D rotating trophy with confetti"
       - Uses Rive for smooth 3D rotation
       - Confetti particles fade in/out (Lottie overlay)
       - Sound: Epic celebration fanfare (optional)
     * Copy: "🏆 30 days! You've officially built a habit.
              This is a milestone most people never reach.
              You're ready for the next level."

   - Upgrade messaging varies by tier:

     IF user.tier == "free":
       * Headline: "Level up your results"
       * Copy: "Join 5,000+ professionals on Core.
               See personalized AI insights. Custom protocols.
               Private accountability challenges."
       * CTA: "Upgrade to Core ($49/month)"
       * Social proof: "10,000+ professionals use Core for
         their wellness goals. See how they improved their sleep
         by 45 mins & energy by 2 points."

     IF user.tier == "core":
       * Headline: "Go Pro: Unlock advanced biometrics"
       * Copy: "Connect your Oura/Whoop. Get real-time
               readiness coaching. 1-on-1 support."
       * CTA: "Upgrade to Pro ($99/month)"
       * IF app version >= 2.0: Offer "14-day Pro trial"

   - Analytics:
     * celebration_30_day_streak
     * paywall_30_day_streak_view
     * paywall_30_day_streak_conversion (if user upgrades)

   - Mark flag: user_celebrations.streak_30_seen = TRUE
```

### 7.2 Refund Reduction Strategies

**STRATEGY 1: Clear Value Communication During Onboarding**

```
RULE: Show tier comparison table DURING onboarding, before first interaction.

Execution:
1. After voice/chat onboarding (completes ~4 minutes in):
   Show screen: "Choose your plan"

2. Display comparison table:

   | Feature | Free | Core | Pro |
   |---------|------|------|-----|
   | AI Coaching Nudges | 1/day | Unlimited | Unlimited + HRV-scaled |
   | Custom Protocols | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
   | Wearable Sync | Apple/Google | Apple/Google | +Oura/Whoop/Fitbit |
   | Private Challenges | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
   | Price | Free | $49/mo | $99/mo |

3. Default selection: "Free" (respects user autonomy)
   - CTA: "Start Free" or "Try Core 7 days"

4. Add badges:
   - "🎁 Most popular" (next to Core)
   - "👑 For power users" (next to Pro)

Rationale: Users who understand tier structure at Day 0
are 40% less likely to refund because expectations are clear.
Clear value communication reduces refunds by ~2-3 percentage points.
```

**STRATEGY 2: Onboarding Quality (First 7 Days = Refund Prevention)**

```
RULE: New Core users receive "Welcome to Core" onboarding checklist.

Execution:
IF user.tier == "core"
   AND user.trial_start_date == TODAY()
   THEN:

1. Day 0 (Onboarding day):
   - Show checklist: "Your first week on Core"
   - Items:
     * ✅ Explore advanced analytics dashboard
     * ✅ Build your first custom protocol
     * ✅ Connect wearable (optional, Pro feature)
     * ✅ Invite 1 friend to private challenge
   - Rationale: Immediate value demonstration prevents refunds

2. Day 1 (Follow-up):
   - Email: "Getting the most out of Core"
     * Subject: "3 things successful users do on Day 1"
     * Body:
       - Link 1: "Set up your personalized coaching schedule"
       - Link 2: "See how personalized recommendations work"
       - Link 3: "Join the Core community"
   - Push: "Your first personalized nudge is ready 🎯"

3. Day 3 (Engagement check):
   - Push: "See how Core is already working for you"
     * Show metric: "You're on track for 6x/week adherence"
     * OR (if low engagement): "Need help getting started?
       Let's talk to an AI coach."

4. Day 5 (Retention signal):
   - Email: "Success stories: How Core users built lasting habits"
     * Show 2-3 testimonials from Day 30+ users
     * Headline: "These users are 40% more consistent since Day 5"

5. Day 6 (Pre-renewal reminder):
   - Email + Push: "Your trial ends tomorrow"
     * Copy: "You're doing great. Keep your momentum going."
     * CTA: "Continue on Core ($49/month)"
             OR "Need more time? Pause for 30 days"
     * Secondary: "Questions? Chat with our AI coach"
     * [NOTE: Pause option prevents forced refund requests]

Metric to track: trial_day_1_to_7_engagement
- Expected: 70%+ of trial users complete ≥3 onboarding items
- Correlation: Users completing 3+ items have <2% refund rate
  vs. <1 item users with 8-10% refund rate
```

**STRATEGY 3: Refund Offer Alternatives (Downgrade, Pause, Refund)**

```
RULE: When user requests refund, offer alternatives BEFORE processing.

Trigger: User navigates to "Cancel Subscription" flow

Step 1: Exit survey (required):
- Question: "What could we have done better?"
  * Multiple choice:
    - "Too expensive"
    - "Not using the features"
    - "Technical issues"
    - "Found a better app"
    - "Life circumstances changed"
  * Open-ended option: "Tell us more..."

Step 2: Offer alternatives (based on response):

IF response == "Too expensive":
  - Offer A: "Pause for 30 days" (no charge, can resume anytime)
  - Offer B: "Downgrade to Free tier" (keep all data, progress intact)
  - Offer C: "Discount: 50% off next 3 months" (if high-value user)

IF response == "Not using features":
  - Offer: "Let's find the right protocol for you"
    * Show 2-min protocol recommendation quiz
    * CTA: "Find your ideal protocol, stay on Core"
  - Alternative: "Downgrade to Free, upgrade when ready"

IF response == "Technical issues":
  - Offer: "Chat with support" (live or AI agent)
  - Offer: "Full refund + 1-month free credit when issues resolve"

IF response == "Life circumstances changed":
  - Offer: "Pause for 60 days (free, no charge)"
  - Alternative: "Refund + win-back offer: 1 month free if you return
    within 90 days"

Step 3: Analytics tracking:
- refund_reason_selected (required before processing)
- alternative_offered
- IF user accepts alternative:
  - refund_prevented = TRUE
  - track_retention_of_saved_user
- IF user proceeds to refund:
  - refund_processed_reason = reason_selected
  - Expected: 30-40% of refund requests convert to pause/downgrade

Expected impact: Reduce effective churn rate by 5-8% through
pause/downgrade alternatives vs. full refunds.
```

## 8. Referral & Viral Growth Mechanics

### 8.1 Share Card Generation for Social Virality

```
SHARE_CARD_SPECIFICATIONS:
  - Auto-generate milestone graphics: branded, protocol name, days, optional avatar
  - Shareable via system sheet (Instagram/TikTok/Twitter)
  - No biometric/private data, only streak counts/protocols
  - Referral code embedded; tracked for Pro tier reward

IMPLEMENTATION:
FUNCTION ON_BADGE_SHARE_CLICK(badge_id):
    // Step 1: Generate share card image (Canvas API)
    share_card = GENERATE_SHARE_CARD(
      template: "gradient_background.png",  // Brand colors gradient
      text: "🔥 {badge.name} on Wellness OS\nEvidence into action.\n{current_streak}-day streak",
      badge_image: badge.image,
      logo: "wellnessos_logo_white.png",
      size: {width: 1080, height: 1920}  // Instagram story dimensions
    )

    // Step 2: Add App Store link overlay
    share_card = ADD_TEXT_OVERLAY(
      text: "Download: wellnessos.app",
      position: "bottom",
      font_size: 24
    )

    // Step 3: Save to device
    file_path = SAVE_TO_DEVICE(share_card, "wellnessos_badge.png")

    // Step 4: Open Instagram share sheet (platform-specific)
    IF platform = "iOS":
      OPEN_SHARE_SHEET(
        items: [file_path],
        activities: ["Instagram Stories", "Instagram Feed", "More"]
      )
    ELSE IF platform = "Android":
      OPEN_SHARE_INTENT(
        type: "image/png",
        file_path: file_path,
        package: "com.instagram.android"
      )

    // Step 5: Log event
    LOG_EVENT("Badge_Shared", {badge_id, platform, timestamp: NOW()})

SHARE_TEMPLATES:
  "30_day_streak": {background: "gold_gradient.png", emoji: "🏆"},
  "100_day_streak": {background: "diamond_gradient.png", emoji: "🚀"},
  "nsdr_unlock": {background: "blue_gradient.png", emoji: "🧘"}
```

### 8.2 Referral Tracking & Rewards

**Referral Code System:**

```
REFERRAL_CODE_GENERATION:
  - Generate unique 6-character alphanumeric code per user
  - Format: WO-ABC123 (WO = Wellness OS prefix)
  - Embed in share cards, invite links, email signatures

REFERRAL_ATTRIBUTION:
  - Track: referral_code → new_user_signup
  - Reward: Referring user gets 1 month Pro tier free after referral completes 7-day streak
  - New user: No penalty/requirement (doesn't affect their experience)

REFERRAL_REWARD_LOGIC:
  IF referred_user.streak_count >= 7:
    TRIGGER_REWARD(referring_user_id, "1_month_pro_free")
    SEND_NOTIFICATION(
      title: "Referral Reward Unlocked! 🎁",
      body: "{Referred_User_Name} completed their 7-day streak. You've earned 1 month Pro free!",
      action_url: "/account/subscription"
    )
```

**Viral Coefficient Tracking:**

```
VIRAL_METRICS:
  - K-factor = (Invites sent per user) × (Conversion rate of invites)
  - Target K-factor: ≥0.5 (50% of users invite 1+ friend, 50% of invites convert)
  - Track: share_card_generated → share_card_viewed → referral_signup

Analytics Events:
  - share_card_generated (badge_id, platform)
  - share_card_viewed (referral_code, source)
  - referral_signup (referral_code, new_user_id)
  - referral_reward_claimed (referring_user_id, reward_type)
```

---

## 9. Personalization & User Segmentation

### 9.1 Behavioral Cohorts

```
USER_SEGMENTATION:
  - High Adherence: ≥6 days/week for 2+ consecutive weeks
  - Medium Adherence: 4-5 days/week
  - Low Adherence: <4 days/week
  - Lapsed: 0 days for 7+ consecutive days
  - Trial Users: Active trial, <7 days since trial start
  - Paid Users: Active subscription, no trial
  - At-Risk: High adherence previously, now <4 days/week for 2 weeks

COHORT_BASED_MESSAGING:
  IF user_segment == "High Adherence":
    NUDGE_TONE = "Celebratory + Expansion"
    EXAMPLE: "30 days at 6+/week! Ready to add evening wind-down?"

  IF user_segment == "At-Risk":
    NUDGE_TONE = "Compassionate + Simplification"
    EXAMPLE: "Life got busy? Let's simplify to 1 protocol for now."

  IF user_segment == "Lapsed":
    NUDGE_TONE = "Curious + Restart"
    EXAMPLE: "What got in the way? Let's find what works for you."
```

### 9.2 Progressive Profiling Data Use

```
PROFILE_ENRICHMENT:
  - Day 2: difficulty_preference → scales protocol intensity
  - Day 3: interest_areas → determines protocol expansion order
  - Day 5: sleep_baseline → tracks improvement metrics
  - Day 7: social_opt_in → enables challenge invites
  - Day 10: goal_progress_self_report → validates hypothesis
  - Day 14: full_profile_completion → unlocks advanced analytics

ADAPTIVE_RECOMMENDATIONS:
  IF user.difficulty_preference <= 2:  // Too easy
    RECOMMEND: More challenging protocol variations
    EXAMPLE: "Morning Light 10 min" → "Morning Light 30 min + Movement"

  IF user.interest_areas INCLUDES "Cold Exposure":
    PRIORITIZE: Cold Exposure protocol in expansion suggestions
    UNLOCK: Cold Exposure content in Evidence UX
```

### 9.3 Context-Aware Nudging

```
CONTEXT_SIGNALS:
  - Time of day (morning/afternoon/evening)
  - Day of week (weekday/weekend)
  - Weather (sunny/rainy/cold) → affects outdoor protocol recommendations
  - User location (home/work/traveling) → from device GPS
  - Calendar events (if integrated) → avoid nudges during meetings
  - Wearable readiness (HRV, sleep score) → scale protocol intensity

CONTEXTUAL_NUDGE_LOGIC:
  IF time == "morning" AND weather == "sunny" AND readiness >= 0.7:
    PRIORITIZE: "Morning Light Exposure" (optimal conditions)

  IF time == "evening" AND readiness <= 0.4:
    PRIORITIZE: "Sleep Wind-Down" (low energy, need rest)

  IF day_of_week IN ["Saturday", "Sunday"]:
    ADJUST: Nudge time +1 hour (users wake later on weekends)

### Appendix B: Key Formulas & Calculations

**Streak Calculation:**
```
User_Current_Streak = COUNT(consecutive_days_with_protocol_completion >= 1)
Day boundary = midnight in user's local timezone (NOT UTC)
```

**XP Progression (Non-Linear):**
```
Level 1→2: 50 XP
Level 2→3: 100 XP
Level 3→4: 200 XP
Level 4→5: 400 XP
Level 5→6: 800 XP
Formula: XP_required(level) = 50 × 2^(level - 2)
```

**Lapse Detection:**
```
Lapse = (missed_consecutive_days >= 2) OR (weekly_adherence < 4/7 for 2 consecutive weeks)

weekly_adherence = days_with_any_protocol_log / 7
```

**Dismissal Rate (Adaptive Spacing):**
```
dismissal_rate = DISMISSED / (OPENED + DISMISSED) over last 7 days

IF dismissal_rate >= 0.7 for same protocol:
  REDUCE frequency by 50%
```

**D1/D7/D30 Retention:**
```
D1_Activation = (Users with ≥1 protocol completed on Day 0-1) / (Users who completed onboarding) × 100%

D7_Retention = (Users with ≥1 protocol on Day 7) / (Users who completed onboarding on Day 0) × 100%

D30_Adherence = (Users with ≥1 protocol on ≥20 of first 30 days) / (Users who onboarded) × 100%
```

**Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level:**
```
FK Grade = 0.39 × (total_words / total_sentences) + 11.8 × (total_syllables / total_words) - 15.59

Target: FK Grade ≤ 8 (8th grade reading level)
```

**Flesch Reading Ease:**
```
FRE = 206.835 - 1.015 × (total_words / total_sentences) - 84.6 × (total_syllables / total_words)

Target: FRE ≥ 60 (Standard / Easily understood)
```
